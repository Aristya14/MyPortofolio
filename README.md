Result :  the total number of game rounds in group B is slightly higher than the number of game rounds in group A. But the Mann-Whitney U Test shows that there is no statistically significant difference between the groups. So, we can say that changing the gate of the game from level 30 to level 40 has no effect on the game rounds played by the users.

Based on observed, retention rates were slightly higher in group A. According to the chi-square test, the 1-day user retention rates are not statistically different, but the 7-day user retention rate is higher in Group A. So, we can say that changing the gate of the game from level 30 to level 40 has negative effect on the 7-day user retention rate.
